Summary of Findings: 
  I decided to take a look at Coffeehouse coupon data.  I began by looking at overall acceptance rate which was right at 50%.  From there, I decided to start
  looking at how to segment the data to identify trends.  The categories I decided to consider where the number of visits, income, work location (I grouped into office vs non-office jobs),
  whether kids were in the car, and temperature.  

  To identify some initial areas to investigate further I looked at acceptance rates across the groups.  The highest acceptance rate came from drivers who already visited coffee shops on a
  regular basis.  This makes sense - if there is already an established habit, why not save some money in the process.  One interesting finding was that acceptance rate among infrequent
  coffeeshop visitors (<1/month or never) was 35%.
