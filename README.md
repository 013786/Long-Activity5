I decided to look at Coffeehouse coupons

Problem - Looking at a combination of contextual attributes and user attributes, identify a group with a high acceptance rate of coupons while using at least 3 limiting criteria.

Summary of Findings: 
  I started by investigating Coffeehouse coupon data.  To do that, I began by looking at overall acceptance rate which was right at 50%.  From there, I decided to start
  looking at how to segment the data to identify trends.  The categories I decided to consider where the number of visits, income, work location (I grouped into office vs non-office jobs),
  whether kids were in the car, and temperature.  

  To identify some initial areas to investigate further I looked at acceptance rates across the groups.  The highest acceptance rate (66%)came from drivers who already visited coffee shops on a
  regular basis.  This makes sense - if there is already an established habit, why not save some money in the process.  One interesting finding was that acceptance rate among infrequent
  coffeeshop visitors (<1/month or never) was 35%.  One actionable item would be to offer repeated coupons of potentially lower value to see if you can increase the revenue margin and maintain the acceptance rate of the new customer. 

  As I looked at the data, I ended up looking at a grouping of frequent visitors.  I made assumptions about how I would expect acceptance rates to change if I adjusted temp/kids/income/if they had an office job. My conclusion is that I was a terrible guesser and should let the data speak for itseld!  I noticed a real increase in acceptance below $50k vs above, same with an increase for non-office workers.  Actionable steps would be to increase targeting drivers with income under $50K who do not work in offices.

  Some next steps would be to look at how distance impacted acceptance, digging deeper into the reasoning behind a 35% acceptance rate for people who don't frequent coffeehouses, and also a look at use across all coupon types for drivers that don't typically go to one of the business types on a regular basis - great to reward frequent customers but is there additional revenue they can capture in new customers.
